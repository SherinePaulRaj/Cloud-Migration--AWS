        "1. **Creating a VPC:**\n",
        "   - Use the AWS VPC dashboard to create a VPC.\n",
        "   - Specify the IP range within which the network must function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Creating an Internet Gateway:**\n",
        "   - Establish connectivity of virtual servers to the internet by attaching the Internet Gateway to the VPC.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Creating Subnets:**\n",
        "   - Divide the CIDR range into smaller chunks for high availability.\n",
        "   - Create 3 subnets to host web and app servers, each with different IP address ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Creating Routing Tables:**\n",
        "   - Route internet traffic efficiently by associating routing tables with each subnet.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Creating Security Groups:**\n",
        "   - Implement virtual firewalls to avoid malicious traffic and protect the network.\n",
        "   - Configure inbound rules to control traffic, directing external traffic to \"My IP.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Connecting to Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):**\n",

        "- Use AWS Backup to centralize and automate data backup across services.\n",
        "- Steps:\n",
        "   1. Create a backup plan with policies/rules.\n",
